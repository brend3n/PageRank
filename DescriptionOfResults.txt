Unsure whether the results of the algorithm implemented works, I planned to evaluate that the convergence of this algorithm is met correctly. To test this, I ran my algorithm 
and stored the results in an array and ran the diagnostics after it ran. The diagnostics give information such as the number of iterations, the PageRanks of each page,
and the ordering of the pages from largest PageRank to smallest PageRank. I then ran the algorithm again without the check for convergence for 1e6 iterations. Again, the program 
spit out the diagnositcs for this test run. I then compared the values from each test to see if there was any difference in the ordering of the PageRanks and the values
of the PageRanks. Upon observation, the ordering of the pages are the same, however, the PageRanks of each page slightly vary. I took the absolute difference of 
each page's PageRank and noticed that the values at most differed on a minute level that can be considered negligible compared to the algorithm that I implemented with the check for convergence. Upon this data, I can assure that the algorithm that I had implemented for calculating the PageRank is acceptable to some degree. It is clear that the values will
converge to approximately 0 at some point after some number of iterations and because my implementation of PageRank is set to converge once the absolute difference between two page's PageRanks falls below some threshold greater than 0, the values that I obtained in my algorithm should vary from the values in the test run of the algorithm without any bound of
convergence set, but only the number of iterations for the algorithm to run.
